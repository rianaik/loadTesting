# loadTesting
Load Testing using K6 examples.

I have added the k6 projects that I have worked throughout my career and have written blogs on how to implement them too.

### k6-with-har :
    - The directory demonstrates the use of HAR(HTTP Archive) for tracking information between a web browser and a website,
      via Docker container and getting a .har file for furthur processing.
    - You can checkout the blog with detailed instructions can be found [here](https://medium.com/@rianaik/using-k6-and-har-to-automate-load-testing-a62077bf872f).

### postman-to-k6 :
    - The directory consists of Postman API collection and the converted script via using the postman-to-k6 tool. You can checkout a detailed blog with steps to reproduce [here]().
